## 🎯 Learning Philosophy

**Context-driven, progressive learning** based on real developer scenarios:

1. **🛡️ Foundation** - Master daily workflows first
2. **🌳 Collaboration** - Learn branching when working with others  
3. **🍒 Emergency** - Cherry-pick for crisis response
4. **📝 Professional** - Interactive rebase for code review prep
5. **💣 Crisis** - BFG for historical cleanup disasters

**No abstract command memorization** - every Git operation has a story and real consequence.
