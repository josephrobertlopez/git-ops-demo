## 🎭 Seven Developer Stories

| Character | Branch | Scenario | Git Skills |
|-----------|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Sarah** | `main` | First day exploration | `clone`, `status`, `log`, `show` |
| **Alex** | `feature/authentication` | Clean feature development | `branch`, `checkout`, `commit` |
| **Sam** | `feature/ui-improvements` | Parallel development | Branching, `diff`, visual history |
| **Jordan** | `hotfix/security-patch` | Emergency cherry-pick | `cherry-pick`, hotfix workflow |
| **Taylor** | `demo/messy-development` | History cleanup | `rebase -i`, squashing commits |

## 🎯 Learning Philosophy

**Context-driven, progressive learning** based on real developer scenarios:

1. **🛡️ Foundation** - Master daily workflows first
2. **🌳 Collaboration** - Learn branching when working with others  
3. **🍒 Emergency** - Cherry-pick for crisis response
4. **📝 Professional** - Interactive rebase for code review prep
5. **💣 Crisis** - BFG for historical cleanup disasters

**No abstract command memorization** - every Git operation has a story and real consequence.
